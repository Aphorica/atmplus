            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This work is derived from a basic example given in the
              <a href ="https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine" target="_blank">
              JakesGordon/Javascript State Machine</a> package.  The idea is to flesh out how
              a real ATM might be constructed, rather than the simplistic example given.</p>
            <p>States include error handling conditions, cancellation paths, and transaction validate/
              verify paths, as well.</p>
            <h4>Composed States</h4>
            <p>With even something as simple as an ATM application, representing all possible states in
              a single state machine definition can become quite confusing, quickly.  It's extremely
              useful to be able to break FSM definitions into multiple states, with a broadly
              functional overview "controller" FSM that can then hand off control to a 'sub-' FSM, wait
              until that is finished with it's subtask, and then resume the gross state handling.
            </p>
            <p><em>JG's</em> FSM implementation does not provide for sub- FSM definitions.  However, since
              FSMs can be instantiated independently, it's a simple matter to create FSMs as needed, and
              push and pop them on a LIFO stack.  This approach has been used here with good results
              by creating an 'fsm_manager' facility to handle the transitions between FSMs.
            </p>
            <p>To implement this, the data-storage capability within the FSM instance can be used to store
              information differentiating the instances, in this case deposit vs withdrawal transaction
              type.
            </p>
            <h4>State Diagram Generation</h4>
            <p>There are several FSM implementations available for javascript - what makes this implementation
               rise above the rest is the diagram-generation capability, creating <em>dot</em> files
               that can be ingested by <em>GraphViz</em> to generate the diagrams.</p>
            <p>Throughout the development of this project, it's been extremely useful to crank out diagrams
              and refer to them while constructing the app, to insure the app conforms.  The beauty is that
              you quickly see where you may not have correct or have missed states and transitions with the
              diagrams.  It's then a simple matter to change the FSM definitions and crank out another
              set of diagrams from the new definitions.
            </p>
            <p>That is frankly, a killer capability, IMHO - not only is it useful to drive development,
              but it also is a great communication tool to use with the client.  Everyone knows what
              happens at each transition and state.

            <h2>Implementation Highlights</h2>
            <h4>Vue.js Implemetation</h4>
            <p>
              The app is a Vue.js implementation, along with Vuex for data-store handling, and
              VueRouter for routing.  In this app, the data-store is the customer accounts
              and balances.  Ostensibly, for an app of this nature, you wouldn't need routing,
              but the intent was to see how a full application with routing might be implemented
              with the FSM technique.
            </p>
            <h4>fsm_manager/atm_fsm_manager</h4>
            <p>The 'fsm_manager' class and app-specific derived class 'atm_fsm_manager' are at the
              heart of the application, and control how the states are handled.  Some states
              correspond to a visual component, others do not.  The router is handed off to the
              fsm_manager constructor on instantiation.  On a state change, the manager checks
              the router to see if a route exists for the 'to' state (by convention, the route
              is named the same as the state to avoid any mapping requirements.)  If it exists,
              the route is triggered.  If not, control is handed off to 'handleStateChange()',
              which is expected to be implemented in the 'fsm_manager'-derived class.</p>
            <h4>timeout transition</h4>
            <p>
              An ATM would be expected to timeout after a period of inactivity.  This introduces
              timeout transitions from almost every state.  The 'atm_fsm_manager' creates and
              manages the timer.  After 1 minute, the app will time out and revert to the
              'card-return' state.  If the current fsm is the 'atm-transaction' sub-fsm, the
              stack is popped, and the timeout notification is passed to the 'atm-main' fsm.</p>
            <p>this could be generalized into a facility as part of the 'fsm_manager' set.  It
              would require a canonically defined transition - 'timeout',
              and a canonical piece of data contained within the FSM - 'timed-out'. </p>
            <p>This factoring is not complete, yet, but the underpinnings are in place.</p>
            <h4>Error Transitions</h4>
            <p>The error transitions ('transaction-validate', and 'transaction-error') could be handled
              in the Vue components without triggering FSM changes, but I wanted to do this more
              formally - for instance, something else might want to know that an error has occurred.<p>
            <p>
              By triggering an FSM transition to another state, anything can monitor and respond to
              the error condition.
            </p>
            <h4>Leveraging Same Component for Multiple States</h4>
            <p>The 'transaction-validate', 'transaction-verify', and 'transaction-exec' states
              are all handled by a single component, that changes visualization based on the
              state.  To do this requires the component to register with the FSM to receive
              the state-change signal, and then retrieving state information from the current
              fsm.
            </p>
            <h4>Using a Modal Dialog to Respond to State</h4>
            <p>The 'confirm-cancel' state is represented by a modal dialog, rather than a routed
              component.  Again, the intent is to try to provide a well-rounded example.  By
              utilizing the fsm history plugin, it's a simple matter to step back, if cancellation
              is selected.
            </p>
            <h4>Maintaining Information Between States</h4>
            <p>The transaction type, account, and amount values need to be maintained from state
              to state during the transaction cycle.  This is another good utilization of the
              FSM data facility.  Keeping this information here until the transaction has been
              completed isolates it from the data-store, committing only until the transaction
              has been verified and accepted.
            </p>

            <p>These are the diagrams generated from the state definitions of the main and sub-state
              FSM definitions. The output dot files are further massaged to produce some more relevant
              output, highlighting the sub-state instances in the main, and then providing
              simplified schematic diagrams that are a bit uncluttered.

            <h2>Proposed Changes to the FSM Package</h2>
            <p>First off, the package is a terrific implementation.  Following are some thoughts
              that would make it more useful.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Perceived Issues</h3>
            <h4>Diagram Could Be Enhanced</h4>
            <p>The diagramming capability is the singular standout feature of this package.  However,
              there are aspects (used in this application) that aren't reflected in the diagrams that
              would be very helpful if they were.  For instance some states correspond to visual
              components while others do not.  Some states are instances of sub-fsms.  By post
              massaging the dot output, it's possible to do a bit, but more could be build into the
              facility.
            </p>
            <h4>State Definitions Are AdHoc</h4>
            <p>
              One doesn't define states but rather transitions.  States are defined as an aspect
              of the transition.  States then, are something of a byproduct.  It would be better
              (and less prone to error entering states) if states were defined up front.  Then,
              if a non-existent state was entered in the transition, the facility would catch that
              and throw an error.
            </p>
            <h4>Debugging Requires Stepping Through Each State</h4>
            <p>
              This can be tedious.  It would be beneficial to be able to go to a state directly
              during development.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
            <h4>Require State Definitions Up Front</h4>
            <p>This would consist of a list of state names preceding the transition definition
              list.  Doing so would enable:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The transition definition mechanism to catch any undefined states.</li>
                <li>dot directives to be associated with the states.  Useful directives
                  might be initially:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Shape</li>
                    <li>Fill color</li>
                    <li>Text information (GraphViz supports hover tooltips.)</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <h4>Provide Way of Proceeding Directly to A State</h4>
            <p>There may be a way of doing this, already - I haven't investigated.  It's 
              somewhat complicated by the fact that data may be required to go to a given
              state (and would have to be implanted in the fsm before triggering.)  Sub-fsm
              states would add further complication.
            </p>
            <p>Have to think on this some more.</p>
