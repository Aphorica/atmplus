            <h2>Introduction &ndash; Finite State Machines</h2>
            <p>
              An application can be thought of as a collection of states and
              transitions between states.  Transitions should be controlled &ndash; you should only
              be able to proceed from one state to another via a specific functionality
              designed to handle the transition between those states.</p>
            <p>
              A finite state machine describes and implements this collection of states and
              transitions.  It doesn't code anything else &ndash; it doesn't build UI components or
              data structures &ndash; it simply transitions through the defined states on specifically
              defined triggers, notifying your app when a transition occurs.</p>
            <p>
              To build your application using this approach entails listening to the
              finite state machine (fsm, for short) for transition invocations.  To effect
              a transtion, something in your code (likely a UI operation, a timer, or
              task completion) calls the fsm to trigger a given transition and the machine
              then proceeds to the next defined state.
            </p>
            <p>The outfall of using this approach is that the various classes (and components,
              especially) in your application are isolated.  Functionality, in turn, is isolated.
              There are specific (finite) points of interaction, defined by the state machine.
              Each component (or function, if a component isn't involved) implements only the
              functionality necessary for the given state or transition with which it is associated.
            </p>
            <p>Even if you have a multi-purpose component (this application has one), it can
              still behave predictably in a given state &ndash; state is well defined, and
              information tied to that state is discrete.</p>
            <p>You can define broadcast transitions &ndash; for instance this application has a timeout that
              affects practically every state and preempts every transition. That behavior can
              be defined and handled cleanly in the fsm definition.
            </p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The fsm implementation in this demo is the 
              <a href ="https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine" target="_blank">
              JakesGordon/Javascript State Machine</a> package.  It's a very good implementation
              with the added benefit of being able to produce <em>GraphViz</em> diagrams of the
              state directly from the state definition (see below).</p>
            <p>The demo is an amplification of the ATM example in that package. It has been fleshed
              out with real UI components and functions to demonstrate how a real application might
              be built with this technique.</p>
            </p>
            <p>The goals of the demo have been:
              <ul>
                <li>Create a more realistic demo with more realistic states and transitions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Errors</li>
                    <li>Validation/Verify</li>
                    <li>Timeout</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Exercise various ways to respond to transitions and states.</li>
                <li>Make the whole thing work as a full Vue.js application.</li>
                <li>Implement and test fsm composibility.</li>
                <li>Implement as a <em>progressive web app</em> (this is a bonus: the demo is self-contained 
                    &ndash; and should run offline if the browser supports the 'service-worker'
                    functionality.)(currently <em>Chrome</em> and <em>FireFox</em> have the
                    best progressive web app support.)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Composed States</h4>
            <p>With even something as simple as an ATM application, representing all possible states in
              a single state machine definition can become quite confusing, quickly.  It's extremely
              useful to be able to break definitions into multiple fsms, with a broadly
              functional overview "main" or "controller" fsm, that can then hand off control to one
              of potentially several 'sub-fsm' definitions, wait
              until that 'sub-fsm' is finished with it's task, and then resume the top-level state handling.
            </p>
            <p>Ability to define 'sub-sfms' also allows repurposing &ndash; in this case, a 'transaction' fsm
              may be of a deposit or a withdrawal type, but the path within the fsm is essentially the same
              for either, with only minor variations that can be determined by the transaction type.
              Defining a single sub-sfm definition to handle both types reduces code proliferation, and
              enhances maintainability.
            </p>
            <p><em>JG's</em> fsm implementation does not provide for composing state definitions.
              However, since
              fsms can be instantiated independently, it's a simple matter to create them as needed, 
              push them on a LIFO stack, and then pop them at the end of their lifecycle.  This approach
              has been used here with good results by creating an 'fsm_manager' facility to handle the
              pushing and popping of fsms (it's also a good place to implement the timeout facility.)
            </p>
            <p>The data-storage capability within the fsm instance can be used to store
              information differentiating the instances &ndash; in this case, deposit vs withdrawal transaction
              type.  It can also be used to store information as execution proceeds from one state
              to the next (see the transaction sub-fsm.)
            </p>
            <h4>State Diagram Generation</h4>
            <p>There are several fsm implementations available for javascript &ndash; one feature
              that makes this implementation
               rise above the rest is the diagram-generation capability &ndash; creating <em>dot</em> files
               that can be ingested by <em>GraphViz</em> to generate the diagrams.</p>
            <p>Throughout the development of this project, it's been extremely useful to crank out diagrams
              and refer to them while constructing the app, to insure the app conforms or to spot any
              errors or omissions.  The diagram allows you to spot troubles quickly &ndash; 
              It's then a simple matter to change the fsm definitions and crank out another
              set of corrected diagrams for the next iteration.
            </p>
            <p>That is frankly, a killer capability &ndash; not only is it useful to drive development,
              but it also is a great communication tool to use with the client.  Everyone knows what
              happens at each transition and state.

            <h2>Implementation Highlights</h2>
            <h4>Vue.js Implementation</h4>
            <p>
              The app is a Vue.js application, along with Vuex for data-store handling, and
              VueRouter for routing.  In this app, the data-store is the customer accounts
              and balances (representing the bank.)  Ostensibly, for an app of this nature,
              you wouldn't need routing, but the intent was to see how a full application
              with routing might be implemented with the fsm technique.
            </p>
            <h4>fsm_manager/atm_fsm_manager</h4>
            <p>The 'fsm_manager' class and app-specific-derived class 'atm_fsm_manager' are at the
              heart of the application, and control how the states are handled.  Some states
              correspond to a visual component, others do not.  The router is handed off to the
              fsm_manager constructor on instantiation, which now manages routing based on state
              changes.</p>
            <p>On a state change, the manager checks
              the router to see if a route exists for the 'to' state (by convention, the route
              is named the same as the state to avoid any mapping requirements.)  If it exists,
              the route is triggered.  If not, control is handed off to 'handleStateChange()',
              which is expected to be implemented in the 'fsm_manager'-derived class.</p>
            <h4>Timeout Transition</h4>
            <p>
              An ATM would be expected to timeout after a period of inactivity.  This introduces
              timeout transitions from almost every state.  The 'atm_fsm_manager' creates and
              manages the timer.  After 1 minute of inactivity, the app will time out and revert to the
              'card-return' state.  If the current fsm is the 'atm-transaction' sub-fsm, the
              stack is popped, and the timeout notification is passed to the 'atm-main' fsm.</p>
            <p>(Note the timeout transition preempts any other transitions. This is easy to
              implenent in the state handler by checking the 'transition' value, and behaving
              accordingly.)</p>
            <p>Timeout functionality might be a generally useful thing &ndash; it could be generalized
              into a facility as part of the 'fsm_manager' set.  It 
              would require a canonically defined (or registered?) transition &ndash; 'timeout' in
              this case &ndash; 
              and a canonical piece of data contained within the fsm &ndash; 'timed-out', here. </p>
            <p>This factoring is not complete, yet, but the underpinnings are in place.</p>
            <h4>Error Transitions</h4>
            <p>The error transitions ('transaction-invalid', and 'transaction-error') could be handled
              in the Vue components without triggering fsm transitions, but I wanted to do this more
              formally &ndash; for instance, something else might want to know that an error has occurred.</p>
            <p>
              By triggering an fsm transition to another state, anything can monitor and respond to
              the error condition.
            </p>
            <h4>Leveraging Same Component for Multiple States</h4>
            <p>The 'transaction-validate', 'transaction-verify', and 'transaction-exec' states
              are all handled by a single component &ndash; it changes content based on the
              state and state-specific information within the fsm.  To do this requires the
              component to register with the fsm to receive the state-change signal, and then
              retrieving the information from the current fsm when that signal happens.
            </p>
            <h4>Using a Modal Dialog to Respond to State</h4>
            <p>The 'confirm-cancel' state is represented by a modal dialog, rather than a routed
              component.  Again, the intent is to exercise multiple responses to changes.  By
              utilizing the fsm history plugin, it's a simple matter to step back if cancellation
              is accepted or do nothing if rejected .
            </p>
            <h4>Maintaining Information Between States</h4>
            <p>The transaction type, account, and amount values need to be maintained from state
              to state during the transaction cycle.  This is another good utilization of the
              fsm data facility.  Keeping this information here until the transaction has been
              completed isolates it from the data-store, committing to the store only when the
              transaction has been verified and accepted.
            </p>
            <h4>Progressive WebApp</h4>
            <p>Something of a bonus &ndash; if the browser supports it (Chrome, Firefox, currently).
              The demo can be run offline as a Progressive WebApp, and even installed to a
              phone's desktop as a native app.

            <h2>Proposed Changes to the fsm Package</h2>
            <p class="nocolumn">First off, the package is a terrific implementation.  Following is an discussion
              of perceived issues, and proposed solutions to address them.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Perceived Issues</h3>
            <h4>Diagramming Could Be Enhanced</h4>
            <p>The diagramming capability is perhaps <em>the</em> standout feature of this package.
              However,
              there are aspects (used in this application) that aren't reflected in the diagrams that
              would be very helpful if they were.  For instance some states correspond to visual
              components while others do not.  Some states are instances of sub-fsms.  By post
              massaging the dot output, it's possible to do a bit, but more could be build into the
              facility.
            </p>
            <h4>State Definitions Are AdHoc</h4>
            <p>
              In the current implementation, one doesn't define states but rather transitions.
              States are defined as an aspect
              of the transition.  States then, are something of a byproduct.  It would be better
              (and less prone to error entering states) if states were defined up front.  Then,
              if a non-existent state was entered in the transition, the facility would catch that
              and throw an error.
            </p>
            <h4>No Built-In Composibility</h4>
            <p>In the documentation, the package author indicates this is on the list of todos.</p>
            <h4>Debugging Requires Stepping Through Each State</h4>
            <p>
              This can be tedious.  It would be beneficial to be able to go to a state directly
              during development.  It would also enhance testing.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
            <h4>Require (or Allow) State Definitions Up Front</h4>
            <p>This would consist of a list of state names preceding the transition definition
              list.  Doing so would enable:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The transition definition mechanism to catch any undefined states.</li>
              <li>dot directives to be associated with the states (much the same way they are
                associated with transitions, now.  Useful directives might be initially:
                <ul>
                  <li>Shape</li>
                  <li>Fill color</li>
                  <li>Text information (GraphViz supports hover tooltips.)</li>

            <p>The feature could be optional, if you didn't want to break current functionality.  The
              package would simply check to see if a state definition list exists. If it does,
              implement the checks -- if not, proceed as before.

            <h4>One Approach to Composibility &mdash; 'fsm_manager'</h4>
            <p>Adding the concept of 'fsm_manager' makes composibility possible.  It could be
              added to the package.
            </p>
            <h4>Provide Way of Proceeding Directly to A State</h4>
            <p>There may be a way of doing this, already &ndash; I haven't investigated.  It's 
              somewhat complicated by the fact that data may be required to go to a given
              state (and would have to be implanted in the fsm before triggering.)  Sub-fsm
              states would add further complication.</p>
            <p>Have to think on this some more.  One approach might be to record state changes
              (and fsm data changes) and store that recording in some form.  Then, reset original
              state and play back the changes &ndash; unhooking the UI until the last step.  That would
              relieve the necessity of setting up states in a fixture of some sort.
